Base program for control structures

You need to modify this program to do the following steps
1. Depending on their choice ask for coressponding values and print them out (almost done for you)
1 b. See if you can change the if statements to a switch case
2. Put entire structure in a loop that runs until I press q
3. Make sure it checks for bad values (-ve numbers, words?)
4. Add perimeter calculations as separate choices
